This is going to be a bookmark storage system where you can tag your bookmarks, and share them with people. It will be self hosted - all you will need to do is clone this repository.

You are welcome to fork this repository and help out.

**Current Phase:** Planning

## Libraries
This section contains a list o finteresting libraries I have found that may or may not be useful when building this thing:

 - http://www.shayanderson.com/php/php-qr-code-generator-class.htm - A qr code generator

### Still to find
 - website screenshot generator


## Notes
This section contains a bunch of notes that I have made / will make while writing blow worm. Eventually, they will slowly disappear as the help pages are written properly or as I don't need them anymore.
